# What Job Is This, Anyway?: Using LLMs to Classify USAJobs Data Scientist Listings

Abstract: Navigating the federal job market begins with finding appropriate job listings. But for data professionals, discrepancies often arise between the content of the listing - that is, the duties of the job - and either the job title or the occupational code, making this step more difficult. In this presentation, I discuss using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new job titles for listings in occupational code 1560, Data Science. I'll show examples of listings with mismatches between the official job title and the one generated by GPT-3.5 and discuss the potential uses of this for applicants and agencies. I'll also highlight the advantages of using Marvin, a library that lets you use LLMs to solve Natural Language Processing problems by just writing documentation rather than code.
