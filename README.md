#### What Job Is This, Anyway?: Using LLMs to Classify USAJobs Data Scientist Listings

For data professionals, navigating the federal job search begins with identifying job listings that align with your background and interests. In this presentation, I discuss a project that employs GPT-3.5 to label, or classify, federal job listings in order to make these listings more legible for both job seekers and analysts. I'll highlight the extensive array of job titles that GPT-3.5 identifies for listings under occupational code 1560, the data scientist occupation. Afterward, I'll present some model spot checks and outline a more structured assessment approach. Finally, I'll discuss what problems this can solve, which it canâ€™t, and what from this might be useful for your text classification problem.
